Using Bluetooth Connectivity to communicate with Hardware


This program is to be run on a Raspberry PI
We are using the GPIO pins alonside the sensors used namely the Relay Switch (5V, 12A) and the HC05 (Bluetooth Sensor)
The Raspberry Pi we used here was a Raspberry Pi 2B+.
With the upgrade to Raspberry Pi 3B+, we can use the inbuilt Bluetooth Sensor.

List of Components Used :
1. Raspberry Pi 2B+
2. Relay Switch ( depends mainly on the usage, you can also use a 12V relay switch)
3. HC05 Bluetooth Module.

The Relay switch we used cannot be used with the regular Air COnditioners or any other high power requiring devices.
